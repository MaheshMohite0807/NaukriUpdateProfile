# NaukriUpdateProfile

1)In this project I have created an automation script to update your naukri profile by deleting your resume and upload resume from your system in every 3min.
2)I have used Java and selenium for the Automation script.
3)To use this Automation script first you need is Eclipse or spring tool suite IDE, post that you can import the project and provide your email Id and password in application.properties file.
4)Also you need to give the path of resume which you want to upload.
5)Once the required info is given you can run the application and every 3min scheduler will delete and reupload the resume.
